At school I hated science subjects

like physics, chemistry and biology.

You know, and …..I wasn’t very good

at mathematics and things.

I really liked subjects like

history, geography, economics.

Anyway when I went to university

I wanted to do geology

but I couldn’t because I was no good at sciences.

So in the end I did philosophy.
