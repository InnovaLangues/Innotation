<div id="transcriptBE">
  <b>We look at how to make a formal speech. </b> <br><br>
    <strong>DENISE:</strong>
Our keynote speaker is a man who I'm sure is very well known to all of
you. He's Professor of Fruitology at Dubbo University and has written
many books on the subject of tropical fruit. So without further ado,
I'd like to introduce our keynote speaker, Doctor Sam Eriks.<br><br>
    <strong>SAM:</strong> Thankyou Denise. <br>The
Honourable Judith Bryant, Minister for Trade, Professor Eric Vogel,
Professor of Economics at Wagga University, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen. Today's topic 'why bananas are bent' is a very
significant one in terms both of international trade, and culture. In
thinking about the topic, I felt it would be appropriate to address
briefly the history of bananas and banana farming, the many qualities
of bananas, both positive and negative, and of course examine the uses
of the banana.<br>But first let me tell you a story about a banana. <br><br>*********<br>Ladies
and gentlemen, I hope I've been able to clear up a few misconceptions,
and leave you with some new ideas about how we might view bananas in
the future.<br>
    <br> We've seen, in looking at their history, that
bananas have a significant role in many cultures. I've also noted their
positive nutritional qualities. And in addressing the main question,
why bananas are bent - we've learned that the reasons are many and
complex. <br>
    <br>
Madam Chair, thankyou for the opportunity to address the conference
today, and thankyou ladies and gentleman for your kind attention.
</div>
<div class="helptitleBE">Making a formal speech to an audience is a
scary thing for many people - even more so if it's in a language that
is not your first language. What are the things you can do to prepare a
formal speech in English? First of all, let's look at the structure of
the speech. In a formal situation, like a keynote address, the speaker
will be introduced by someone else.</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">Our keynote speaker is a
man who I'm sure is very well known to all of you. He's Professor of
Fruitology at Dubbo University and has written many books on the
subject of tropical fruit.</span></div> 

<div class="helptitleBE">When introducing a speaker, research their
background and accomplishments - that is, the important things they've
done, such as books they may have written, important positions they've
filled, and of course their proper title or qualifications, such as
Professor. <br><br>
Here are some useful phrases to use when introducing a speaker. Practise them with Denise:</div> 

<div class="helpcopyBE"><span class="brown">Our next speaker is well known to all of you.<br><br>

Our next speaker needs no introduction.<br><br>

Without further ado, I'd like to introduce&#8230;<br><br>

Please make him welcome, Doctor Sam Eriks.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">When giving a formal speech to an audience, we
need to be aware of protocol. Protocol means the proper or customary
way of doing things in formal situations. Part of the protocol for a
formal speech is addressing the audience at the beginning. A keynote
speaker needs to know who the important people are at the meeting, and
address them using their formal titles, starting with the most
important people.</div>  

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">Thankyou Denise.<br><br>
The Honourable Judith Bryant, Minister for Trade, Professor Eric Vogel,
Professor of economics at Wagga University, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen. </span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">If there is a representative of government,
such as a minister, they would be acknowledged first - then any other
people of particular note.<br><br>
Include their title,(pause) name (pause) and position. <br><br>
Then he addresses 'distinguished guests' - this can include anyone who has been invited to attend the event. 
And finally he says 'ladies and gentlemen', which means everyone else. <br><br>
What does Doctor Eriks do next?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">In thinking about the
topic, I felt it would be appropriate to address briefly the history of
bananas and banana farming, the many qualities of bananas, both
positive and negative, and of course examine the uses of the banana.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">He outlines the three main  parts of his speech. Listen to him again. What are the three parts of his talk?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">I felt it would be
appropriate to address briefly the history of bananas and banana
farming, the many qualities of bananas, both positive and negative, and
of course examine the uses of the banana.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">The first one is 'the history of bananas and
banana farming', the second one is 'the many qualities of bananas', and
the third one is 'the uses of the banana'. In listing things like this
in a speech, it's important to use pauses in speech so that the
audience can follow and hear the three points. <br><br>How does it sound without pauses?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">I felt it would be
appropriate to address briefly the history of bananas and banana
farming, the many qualities of bananas, both positive and negative, and
of course examine the uses of the banana.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">In making a speech, it's important to use
pauses to help make your point. In the list, pause before each point in
the list. Pause between sentences, and before making a major point,
like this:</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">The point I want to make is this: not all bananas are bent.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">Stress and intonation are important too. In
saying 'not all bananas are bent' - Doctor Eriks stresses the word
'all' because it is the most important word in that statement. In
listing the three parts of his speech, notice how his intonation is
rising in the first two parts, and then falling for the last - this
indicates to the audience he has finished the list:<br><br>

The history of bananas, the many qualities of bananas, and the uses of the banana.<br><br>
In describing his topic, he said 'I felt it would be appropriate to
address&#8230;' and then names the parts of his speech. To 'address'
something here means to talk about it. You could also use words like
'consider', 'discuss', 'outline', 'cover'. <br><br>

Pronunciation is important too - it's a good idea to practise your speech out loud - especially any difficult words. </div> 

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">I've also noted their positive nutrishal, nutrishishional, nutritional qualities.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">What does Doctor Eriks do next in his speech?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">But first let me tell you a story about a banana.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">He says he is going to tell a story about a
banana. When making a speech, it's good to put in some personal touches
- a story of something that happened or a joke. <br><br>We move now to the end of Sam's speech. How does he finish?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">Ladies and gentlemen, I
hope I've been able to clear up a few misconceptions about bananas, and
leave you with some new ideas about how we might view bananas in the
future.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">First, he signals that he is ending his
speech, by repeating 'ladies and gentlemen'. Then he says 'I hope I've
been able to clear up a few misconceptions'. By using the present
perfect 'I have been able' he signals that he is talking about his
speech up to now. Practise with Doctor Eriks some ways of signalling
the end of a speech:</div>

<div class="helpcopyBE"><span class="brown">I hope I've been able to clarify the issue.<br><br>

I hope I've addressed the major concerns about this issue.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">Next he restates the major points he's made. </div> 

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">We've seen, in looking at
their history, that bananas have a significant role in many cultures.
I've also noted their positive nutritional qualities. And in addressing
the main question, why bananas are bent - we've learned that the
reasons are many and complex.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">Notice the use of the present perfect in re-stating these points.<br><br>

We've seen; <br>
'I've noted'; <br>
'we've learned'. <br><br>

There are other phrases that could be used in this way:<br><br>

'We've observed'; 'I've outlined'; 'I've referred to&#8230;' and so on. <br><br>

Finally, how does Doctor Eriks wrap up his speech?</div>

<div class="helpextraBE"><span class="blue">Madam Chair, thankyou for
the opportunity to address the conference today, and thankyou ladies
and gentleman for your kind attention.</span></div>

<div class="helptitleBE">Well, there's a lot more we can say about
making formal speeches, but I hope you've learned some useful tips
today. Thankyou for your attention, and I'll see you next time for The
Business of English.</div>
